NBA 2K13 Workarounds Tool
	by Lefteris "Leftos" Aslanoglou


	Quick Notes
		- Scoreboard
			This is a simple workaround for the "scoreboard disappearing" bug that plagues the retail version of NBA 2K13.
			To have it on top of the game, switch the game to Windowed mode and use the Always on Top switch in the tool. If you want to remove the borders from the game's window, you can try using a tool such as this one:

			I'm looking into providing the option of the scoreboard being an overlay in the game (kind of like FRAPS shows you the framerate), but it's going to need some more research.
			This will have to do until then. Hope it helps!

		- Sliders Import/Export
			This adds the ability to export the sliders part of the Settings file to another file, so that you can keep separate sliders files and be able to switch between them easily.
